# Space Runner Game

This is the first game I made in Unity; it is completed as part of my semester coursework for Computer Games Programming. I used assets from the Unity store, all of which I have referenced below. The mechanics of the game were inpsired by [Brackeys](https://pages.github.com/) amazing tutorial. 

Upon loading a game level, the player's character-an astronut-immediately begins running. The primary objective is to steer the character cleaor of obstacles (asteroids) and avoid collision. Each collision results in the loss of one life. A score counter is also incorporated, allowing the player to accumulate points while actively running through the game. Players can collect items while they are running. A rocket will increase the player's speed, but their score will also increase proportionally. A heart can be collected to avoid dying on a collision. There are traps marked on the ground that, when stepped on, will cause the player's speed to increase drastically, making it very difficult to manuever through obstacles. In the final level, the player has to run in such a way to avoid waking up enemies that will chase and kill the player. In addition, I have added a story to the game to make it more immersive and engaging, and to help smooth out the transitions between levels.

Note: this asset came with a script to animate the breaking of the asteroid. The file is Fracture.cs, 
and it is called (in Player_Collision.cs) when the asteroid is fractured.
